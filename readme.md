### **Title**

*“Data-Driven Assessment and Predictive Modeling of Lithium-Ion Battery Performance and Degradation Patterns”*


### **Abstract**

**Battery performance degradation is one of the most critical challenges affecting the reliability, efficiency, and longevity of modern energy storage systems. This research investigates the performance behavior of lithium-ion batteries through a comprehensive data-driven approach, combining experimental test data and open-source datasets. The study focuses on extracting meaningful parameters such as capacity fade, internal resistance evolution, coulombic efficiency, and thermal response across multiple charge–discharge cycles.**

**Through advanced feature engineering and statistical analysis, the project identifies key operational factors influencing degradation—such as C-rate, temperature, and depth of discharge. Machine learning models, including ensemble and sequence-based architectures, are employed to predict State-of-Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from early-cycle data. Comparative evaluation across datasets establishes robust predictive baselines and interpretable degradation signatures.**

**The outcome of this research aims to provide a reproducible framework for real-time battery diagnostics, enhance understanding of degradation mechanisms, and support the design of intelligent battery management systems (BMS) for next-generation electric mobility and energy storage applications.**


Python
```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

!!! note "Battery Performance Observation"
    Cycle 10 showed a voltage drop of 0.2V — likely due to temperature influence.
