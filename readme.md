### **Abstract**

**Battery performance degradation is one of the most critical challenges affecting the reliability, efficiency, and longevity of modern energy storage systems. This research investigates the performance behavior of lithium-ion batteries through a comprehensive data-driven approach, combining experimental test data and open-source datasets. The study focuses on extracting meaningful parameters such as capacity fade, internal resistance evolution, coulombic efficiency, and thermal response across multiple charge–discharge cycles.

Through advanced feature engineering and statistical analysis, the project identifies key operational factors influencing degradation—such as C-rate, temperature, and depth of discharge. Machine learning models, including ensemble and sequence-based architectures, are employed to predict State-of-Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from early-cycle data. Comparative evaluation across datasets establishes robust predictive baselines and interpretable degradation signatures.

The outcome of this research aims to provide a reproducible framework for real-time battery diagnostics, enhance understanding of degradation mechanisms, and support the design of intelligent battery management systems (BMS) for next-generation electric mobility and energy storage applications.**
